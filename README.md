# Infinite Menagerie
In the silence of the collection, it is not only thoughts that awaken, but instincts. You are a fragile mannequin, cast by fate as a warrior. An endless tide of animal figurines and elemental chaos descends upon you. Every battle is a tactical puzzle, every choice is between survival and being returned to dust.

## Description
Infinite Menagerie is a turn-based strategy game in which you take control of a living mannequin to battle endless waves of animated figurines of forest creatures. Use tactics, cunning, and your character's abilities. Remember: your faceless mannequin is unique—it can temporarily wear the masks of other figurines, thereby adopting their abilities. From time to time, you will encounter the Merchant of the Secret Shop on your path, who will offer you rare items for a certain price.
