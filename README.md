# Infinite Menagerie
In the silence of the collection, it is not only thoughts that awaken, but instincts. You are a fragile mannequin, cast by fate as a warrior. An endless tide of animal figurines and elemental chaos descends upon you. Every battle is a tactical puzzle, every choice is between survival and being returned to dust.

## Description
Infinite Menagerie is a turn-based strategy game in which you take control of a living mannequin to battle endless waves of animated figurines of forest creatures. Use tactics, cunning, and your character's abilities. Remember: your faceless mannequin is unique—it can temporarily wear the masks of other figurines, thereby adopting their abilities. From time to time, you will encounter the Merchant of the Secret Shop on your path, who will offer you rare items for a certain price.

Welcome to Infinite Menagerie! Here, you will test your strength in battles against the forest's inhabitants and spirits. The goal of the game is to escape the ever-expanding forest by defeating three forest masters. Let's take a look at the tools you will use to find your way out. First of all, Infinite Menagerie is a turn-based strategy, so on the clock above you can see whose turn it is and how many waves you've survived. Your turn ends when your character's Action Points (AP) is depleted. A wave is completed when all enemies are defeated. After each survived enemy wave, you'll receive a certain amount of gold commensurate with the difficulty of the completed wave.

Now let's examine your character. Note their distinctive sign: it shows the main attribute that determines damage of various attack types: red - strength, green - agility, and blue - intelligence. Character stats depend on these attributes. The main abilities are located along the left border - hover your mouse over them to learn more. Each standard ability, except skip turn, consumes AP. Along the bottom border are attribute signs. The stats are located in the upper left corner: Health Points (HP), Magic Points (MP), and Action Points (AP). Along the bottom border is your inventory. It can contain various items, some with active abilities that consume MP and AP


Excellent! You're now fully prepared for endless battle. Stay focused and good luck will never leave you.
